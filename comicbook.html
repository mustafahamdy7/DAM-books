The experiment failed, and now causes Banner to transform into a green, hulking and gigantic creature, with super-human strength and durability, whenever his heart rate goes above 200 bpm or if he is placed in mortal danger. The character is one of the central protagonists of the MCU, having appeared in eight films of the series and is depicted as one of the most powerful members of the Avengers.The Hulk is incredibly strong and throughout most of the films he acts largely on the instinct of self-preservation, attacking anything that he perceives as a threat. Over time, Banner demonstrated an increasing ability to control the transformation, calling the Hulk at will, but was generally not able to recall events during the time he was in that form. The Hulk, conversely, became increasingly aware of Banner and able to stall the transformation back—one time staying in Hulk form for two years, becoming able to speak with others and control his destructive rage. Eventually, Banner was able to merge with the Hulk, combining Banner's mind and personality with the Hulk's body and strength.
